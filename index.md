### osci in continuous culture 

red/blue genes in cyano and yeast

--- .class #id 

oscillation: period distinct from cell cycle, but synchronization
and semi-linear relations; continuous culture! 

--- .class #id 

red/blue genes always similar in oscillations, but also occur at end 
of batch!

--- .class #id 

red/blue genes: meta-transcriptome -> growth rate 

--- .class #id 

growth laws: simple relations with growth rate, koch1988,
limiting is membrane space, heijnen92

recent trade-off models: protein costs

--- .class #id 

-> model yeast/coilseq - sequence-dependence of DNA state!


--- .class #id 

### stress

red/blue genes in batch growth:

yeast diauxie: expo phase is not "balanced", slow transition, atp-model?

-> e.coli/cyano: analyzed by fritz, the segmenTier, see talk by Kai

blue genes!? phase of low energy, stress, differentiation 

--- .class #id 

stress: P-bodies form, cell becomes granular, phase-transition

show osci water structure paper

--- .class #id 

amariei: three phases of nucleosome condensation

--- .class #id 

-> model chromatin remodeling, but ATP/ADP general, electron transport chain

--- .class #id 

RNAseq

noncoding, antisense expression: only during low energy phase

upstream noncoding: detected by Karl, segmenTier, potentially new mechanism
after yeast WGD

--- .class #id 

THE END: concepts and tools for bacteria, coilseq

--- .class #id
