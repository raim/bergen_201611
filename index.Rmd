## Respiratory Oscillations in Budding Yeast 

red/blue genes in cyano and yeast

--- .class #id 

### Varying Periods

oscillation: period distinct from cell cycle, but synchronization
and semi-linear relations; continuous culture! 

--- .class #id 

### Gene Expression `constant' 

red/blue genes always similar in oscillations, but also occur at end 
of batch!

--- .class #id 

### Gene Expression & Growth Laws

red/blue genes: meta-transcriptome -> growth rate 

***

```{r, echo=FALSE}
(plot(0:20, 0.001 *exp(0.1*0:20)))
```

--- .class #id 

### Growth Laws: Linear Relations

growth laws: simple relations with growth rate, koch1988,
limiting is membrane space, heijnen92

recent trade-off models: protein costs

--- .class #id 

### A Working Hypothesis

-> model yeast/coilseq - sequence-dependence of DNA state!


--- .class #id 

## Growth & Stress

red/blue genes in batch growth:

yeast diauxie: expo phase is not "balanced", slow transition, atp-model?

blue genes!? phase of low energy, stress, differentiation 

--- .class #id 

## Platereader Growth in E. coli

... analyzed by Fritz, the Platypus

--- .class #id 

### Stress & Cell Structure 

[//]: # (Comment ![Fritz](assets/img/fritz_the_platypus.gif))

stress: P-bodies form, cell becomes granular, phase-transition

show osci water structure paper

--- .class #id 

### Stress & Chromatin

amariei: three phases of nucleosome condensation

--- .class #id 

### Working Hypothesis: Chromatin Remodeling

-> model chromatin remodeling, but ATP/ADP general, electron transport chain

--- .class #id 

### RNA sequencing

RNAseq data!

noncoding, antisense expression: only during low energy phase

upstream noncoding: detected by Karl, segmenTier, potentially new mechanism
after yeast WGD

--- .class #id 

## THE END: concepts and tools for bacteria, coilseq

--- .class #id
